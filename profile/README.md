# Ceres
Ceres is a modern, fast and lightweight native text editor built from scratch using OpenGL and Python. 

Thanks to it being native and not Electron based (looking at you VS Code), it starts up fast and stays that way no matter the size of your project. Ceres is still in its infancy. I currently working on developing a custom GUI with OpenGL so that it will always be customizable and configurable. I plan on adding GPU rendering to speed up the UI and import the UX.
